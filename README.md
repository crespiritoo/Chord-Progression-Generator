# Chord-Progression-Generator
This is code for a chord progression generator that generates progressions based on user inputs such as genre, time signature, mode and key
This code is for a school project in which i have to measure user feedback, so it would be greatly appreciated if, after utilizing the app, you filled this google docs form
